üöÄ Key Features
ü§ñ AI-Powered Analysis: Leverages Google's Gemini AI to synthesize data and identify strategic content gaps.

üìä Multi-Source Data Aggregation: Fetches data from GNews, YouTube (popular and competitor videos), and Reddit to get a 360-degree view of the market.

üí° Automated Ideation: Automatically generates 5-7 relevant, low-competition video topic ideas in a single run.

üìÖ Content Calendar Integration: Directly populates a Google Sheet with new ideas, including titles, keywords, rationale, and status.

üì¢ Team Notifications: Instantly alerts the content team via Slack when new ideas are ready for review.

‚öôÔ∏è Fully Automated: Designed to run on a schedule (e.g., weekly) to continuously supply fresh content ideas.

‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
Collect Data: The workflow fetches the latest articles, videos, and posts from GNews, YouTube, and a targeted Reddit community.

Pre-process: All the gathered data is combined and cleaned by a Code node into a single object for the AI.

Analyze with AI: The structured data is sent to the Gemini AI model with a prompt instructing it to act as a content strategist and find content gaps.

Parse & Normalize: The AI's JSON response is parsed, and the data for each topic is cleaned and standardized.

Log Ideas: Each topic suggestion is appended as a new row to a "Content Ideas" Google Sheet.

Notify Team: A final notification is sent to a Slack channel to let the team know that new ideas are available for review.

üöÄ How to Use
This workflow is designed to be run on a schedule (e.g., using a Cron node once a week) or triggered manually whenever you need a fresh batch of content ideas.

üß© Customization Ideas
Add More Sources: Integrate with other platforms like Twitter, news APIs, or other subreddits.

Use Different Models: Swap out Gemini for another model like OpenAI's GPT-4.

Enhance the Prompt: Refine the prompt sent to the AI to ask for different formats, like blog post ideas or short-form video concepts.

Create a Dashboard: Use the data in the Google Sheet to power a Looker Studio or Grafana dashboard to track content performance.
